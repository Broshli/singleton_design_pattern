class Singleton1{
    Singleton1? _instance;  // this is an instance of this class
}

Singleton1 singleton1 = Singleton1();
singleton1.any_function_name();
Singleton1 singleton2 = Singleton1();
Singleton1 singleton3 = Singleton1();
Singleton1 singleton4 = Singleton1();
Singleton1 singleton5 = Singleton1();

singleton1, singleton2, singleton3, singleton4 and singleton5 are all the instance of Singleton1 class

In Dart the _internal can be used in outside the class it is not a class based instance variable it is file base it mean we can use Singleton1._internal anywhere we wand in the file but not out side the file.
